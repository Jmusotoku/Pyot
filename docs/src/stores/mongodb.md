# Mongo DB

- Type: <Badge text="Pyot Cache" vertical="middle" /> <Badge text="Sharding" type="error" vertical="middle" />
- Description: Store that uses Mongo NoSQL DBs as Caches. This cache provides high speed read/write in disk persistent storage, objects expirations are handled by Mongo's TTL indexes.

:::danger DEPRECATION
Since v3.1.0 this store will start migrating to use the bson format, which allows queries into the cached objects (or potentially stored forever objects) and bulk requesting without the need of readding them in another database. Old cached objects won't be returned and deleted afterwards. Flushing your mongo db or calling `clear()` is recommended.

:::tip INFO ABOUT THIS STORE
This store is best for production environment due to its high speed, TTL indexes and mainly disk based storage. Built on top of Python Async Driver of MongoDB [Motor](https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Multiple instances of MongoDB is allowed, DB level sharding is also possible by following the Mongo's docs for sharding and pass the necessary kwargs to the settings.

Objects are stored as bytes strings serialized by `pickle` due to faster performance than bson format, to get a cached object from the db without using pyot's pipeline, `pickle.loads()` is needed for deserializing to python dictionary and further able to jsonify. (The util function `pytify` from `pyot.utils` also works)

## Cached Endpoints

All available endpoints defined in the [default expirations](/pipeline/expiration.html#default-expirations). Endpoints are also documented under each service store documentation.

## Example Usage

In your Pyot settings.

```python{3}
    # PIPELINE ...
        {
            "BACKEND": "pyot.stores.MongoDB",
            "DB": 'pyot_lol',
            "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
            "PORT": 27017,
            "LOG_LEVEL": 10,
            "EXPIRATIONS": {...},
        },
    # ....
```
